# JAVA-PROGRAMS-TASK.3-
This repository contains six simple Java programs designed to practice core programming cocepts. Each program demonstrate basic programming concepts such as user input, loops, conditional statements, and string manipulation.

List of Programs:
1.Student Data Input

2.Sum of Two Numbers

3.Even or Odd Checker

4.Factorial Calculation

5.Prime Number Checker

6.String Reversal



1.Student Data Input
File: StudentData.java

Description: This program takes input for student details, including name, ID, age, fee, and grade. It then displays the collected information.

How to Run: javac StudentData.java java StudentData

Concepts Used: classes, objects, constructors.

2.Sum of Two Numbers
File: SumTwoNumbers.java

Description: This program takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. It then displays the result.

How to Run: javac SumTwoNumbers.java java SumTwoNumbers

Concepts Used: Basic input output and arithmetic operations.

3.Even or Odd Checker
File: EvenOddCheck.java

Description: This program checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator (%).

How to Run: javac EvenOddCheck.java java EvenOddCheck

Concepts Used: Conditional statements (if-else), input from the user.

4.Factorial Calculation
File: Factorial.java

Description: This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop.

How to Run: javac Factorial.java java Factorial

Concepts Used:loops(for or while), mathmatical operations.

5.Prime Number Checker
File: PrimeCheck.java

Description: This program checks if a number is prime. It uses a loop up to âˆšn for optimization.

How to Run: javac PrimeCheck.java java PrimeCheck

Concepts Used:loops conditional statements, and number properties

6.String Reversal
File: ReverseString.java

Description: This program takes a string input and reverses it using StringBuilder.

How to Run: javac ReverseString.java java ReverseString

Concepts Used:string manipulation, loops, or build in string methods.

Prerequisites :

Install Java Development Kit (JDK).

Ensure javac and java commands are available in your terminal.
